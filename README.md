# ArcticInvasion
This repository contains the R code used for the ensemble models in "What and where? Predicting invasion hotspots in the Arctic marine realm".

The scripts used to run the models, extract/visualise the results, and create the ensembles may be found in the /analyses/ folder and are numerated for convenience. A variety of intermediate and supplementary visuals may be found in the /graph/ folder. Metadata used to inform the models, and to succinctly summarise the results may be found in the /metadata/ folder.
